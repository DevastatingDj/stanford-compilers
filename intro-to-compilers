Intro to Compilers

Compilers vs Interpreters

Compilers – Compiler takes the program converts it into an executable (bytecode) which can be run on different data to produce output.

Interpreters – Interpreters takes the program and the data(input) and gives the output. Does not do any preprocessing on the program before it executes it on the input.

Moder Compilers preserve the outline of FORTRAN I

It consists of 5 phases:

* Lexical Analysis
* Parsing
* Semantic Analysis
* Optimization
* Code Generation
