Classroom Object Oriented Language -> COOL

Designed to be implementable in a short time

In this course we will be building a complete compiler in 5 Programming Assn.

Cool -> MIPS assembly language
* Mips is real instruction set. It was for a machine that was designed in the
1980's. There is simulator for MIPS that runs on just about any kind of
hardware

5 Prgramming Assignments
* Write a COOL program (which will itself be an interpreter)
* Lexical Analysis
* Parsing
* Semantic Analysis
* Code generation

These four phases will be plug compatible(meaning you can plug your component
into a reference compiler to check)
