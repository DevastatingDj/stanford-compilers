* Every cool program has to have a class main. Every class declaration must
terminated by a semicolon. So a program consist of a list of class declaration

* main() method of the Main class must always exist. This is the method that
will run to start the program. This method must take no arguments. Methods
are also terminated by a semicolon 

* Cool methods must declare a return type.

Example:

class Main {

	main():Int { 1 };

};

Note - This is not going to produce any output

* To produce an output we need to declare an attribute of the class IO
and use the method i.out_string(). In the next example we will print a
statement and put our 1 in a statement block. Statement block consist of a 
sequence of expression separated by semicolons. And the value of the block is
the value of the last expression. 

* Statement block or an expression block has to be included in its own set of
 curly braces.

Examples:

class Main{

	i: IO <- new IO;
	main():Int{ { i.out_string("Hello World\n"); 1; } };

};


class Main{

	i:IO <- new IO;
	main():IO { i.out_string("Hello World\n") };

};


class Main{

        i:IO <- new IO;
        main():Object { i.out_string("Hello World\n") };

};


class Main {
	main():Object { (new IO).out_string("Hello World\n") };
};


class Main inherits IO{
	main():Object { self.out_string("Hello World!\n") };
};
